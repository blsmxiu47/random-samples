# Random Samples
A Streamlit app.

## Proposal
Demonstrate Streamlit functionality and ease-of-use with simulations of random sampling from a few (or several?, tbd) probability distributions. Ideally the user can select parameters and see the sample distribution update in real time along with statistics such as sample mean, stdev, etc.
