# Random Samples

A Streamlit app. Explore common probability distributions and generate random samples from said distributions.

## Proposal

Demonstrate Streamlit functionality and ease-of-use with simulations of random sampling from a few probability distributions. The user can select parameters and see the sample distribution update in real time along with statistics such as sample mean, stdev, etc.

## To-Dos

- Add visualization functionality for more distributions (discrete and continuous)
- Enhance informativeness and interactivity of visuals, in particular adding more detail to the random sample chart(s)
- Include additional stats tools such as parameter estimation simulation(s), hypothesis testing, etc.
